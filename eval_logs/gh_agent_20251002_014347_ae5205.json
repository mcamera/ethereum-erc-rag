Traditional mechanisms in DeFi often require asset holders to lock up their assets for participation in activities such as lending, staking, or yield farming, which results in a loss of liquidity. This standard aims to introduce a more flexible approach, allowing asset holders to retain some liquidity while their assets are locked, thereby enhancing the utility and appeal of DeFi products.\n\n### Design Decision\n\n- Dual-Role System (Asset Owner and DeFi Platform/Contract): A clear division is established between the NFT owner (asset holder) and the DeFi platform or contract utilizing the NFT as collateral. This distinction simplifies the management of rights and responsibilities, enhancing clarity and reducing potential conflicts.\n\n- Enhancing Liquidity without Compromising Asset Locking Benefits: A key feature of this standard is enabling asset owners to use their NFTs, which represent locked assets, as collateral to secure loans. This approach allows asset owners to access liquidity without needing to withdraw their assets from pools or staking programs, thus preserving the associated benefits like interest accrual or voting rights.\n\n- Automated Loan and Collateral Management: The integration of automated features for managing the terms and conditions of the collateralized NFT is a deliberate choice to minimize transaction costs and complexity.\n\n- DeFi Composability: The strategic emphasis on DeFi composability, particularly the integration between asset-locking and collateralizing services, is pivotal for this standard. This approach aims to streamline the adoption of the standard across diverse DeFi platforms and services, fostering seamless connections within the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n### Alternate Designs and Related Work\n\n- Comparison with [ERC-4907](./eip-4907.md): While [ERC-4907](./eip-4907.md) also introduces a dual-role model for NFTs (owner and user), our standard focuses specifically on the use of NFT",

These NFTs denote the rights to the assets and the associated benefits, but they also lock the assets in the pool, often causing liquidity challenges for the providers. The current practice requires providers to withdraw their assets for urgent liquidity needs, adversely affecting the pool's liquidity and potentially increasing slippage during asset swaps.\n\nOur proposal allows these NFTs, representing locked assets in liquidity pools, to be used as collateral. This approach enables liquidity providers to gain temporary liquidity without withdrawing their assets, maintaining the pool's liquidity levels. Furthermore, it extends to a broader range of DeFi services, including lending and trading, where asset locking is prevalent. By allowing the collateralization of locked asset representations through NFTs, our approach aims to provide versatile liquidity solutions across DeFi services, benefitting a diverse user base within the ecosystem.\n\nThe concept of perpetual contract NFTs, which we introduce, exploits the idea of perpetual futures contracts in the cryptocurrency derivatives market. These NFTs represent the rights to the perpetual contract and its collateral, enabling them to be used effectively as collateral for DeFi composability. The perpetual contract NFT offers a new form of NFT that enhances the utility of locked assets, providing a significant advantage in DeFi applications by offering liquidity while retaining the benefits of asset locking.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.\n\n### Contract Interface\n\nSolidity interface.\n\n```solidity\n    interface IPerpetualContractNFT {\n\n        // Emitted when an NFT is collateralized for obtaining a loan\n        event Collateralized(uint256 ind",

Composability serves as the missing piece in creating a more efficient market.\n- Smart contract vulnerabilities: NFTs are susceptible to loss or theft due to potential bugs or vulnerabilities present in the smart contracts they rely on.\n\nThe aforementioned issues contribute to a poor user experience (UX), and we propose enhancing the [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) standard by implementing a native locking mechanism: \nRather than being transferred to a smart contract, an NFT remains securely stored in self-custody but is locked. \nDuring the lock period, the NFT's transfer is restricted while its other properties remain unchanged. \nNFT Owner retains the ability to use or distribute it\u2019s utility.\n\nNFTs have numerous use cases where the NFT must remain within the owner's wallet, even when it serves as collateral for a loan.

              "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis standard is an extension of [EIP-721](./eip-721.md). It introduces lockable NFTs. The locked asset can be used in any way except by selling and/or transferring it. The owner or operator can lock the token. When a token is locked, the unlocker address (an EOA or a contract) is set. Only the unlocker is able to `unlock` the token.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith NFTs, digital objects become digital goods, which are verifiably ownable, easily tradable, and immutably stored on the blockchain. That's why it's very important to continuously improve UX for non-fungible tokens, not just inherit it from one of the fungible tokens.\n\nIn DeFi there is an UX pattern when you lock your tokens on a service smart contract. For example, if you want to borrow some $DAI, you have to provide some $ETH as collateral for a loan. During the loan period this $ETH is being locked into the lending service contract. Such a pattern works for $ETH and other fungible tokens.\n\nHowever, it should be different for NFTs because NFTs have plenty of use cases that require the NFT to stay in the holder's wallet even when it is used as collateral for a loan. You may want to keep using your NFT as a verified PFP on Twitter, or use it to authorize a Discord server through collab.land. You may want to use your NFT in a P2E game. And you should be able to do all of this even during the lending period, just like you are able to live in your house even if it is mortgaged.\n\nThe following use cases are enabled for lockable NFTs:\n\n- **NFT-collateralised loans** Use your NFT as collateral for a loan without locking it on the lending protocol contract. Lock it on your wallet instead and continue enjoying all the utility of your NFT.\n- **No collateral rentals of NFTs** Borrow NFT for a fee, without a need for huge collateral. You can use NFT, but not transfer it, so the lender is safe. The borrowing service contract automatically transfers NFT back to the lender as soon as the borrowing period expires.\n- **P",

          "content": "The primary benefits of using Lockable NFTs, particularly when utilizing them as collateral for loans, revolve around maintaining utility, enhancing liquidity, and improving user experience within the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nKey benefits include:\n\n*   **Retaining NFT Utility and Liquidity:** Lockable NFTs allow the owner to keep the NFT in their wallet while it serves as collateral. This means the owner can continue to use the NFT for its intended purpose (e.g., as a profile picture, for access to exclusive communities, or within play-to-earn games) even while it is locked. This approach enhances the overall utility and appeal of DeFi products by allowing asset holders to access liquidity without compromising the benefits associated with their locked assets, such as interest accrual or voting rights.\n    [[Lockable Extension for ERC-721](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-7066.md)]\n    [[Lockable Extension for EIP-721](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-5753.md)]\n    [[Perpetual Contract NFTs as Collateral](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-7565.md)]\n\n*   **Enhanced DeFi Composability:** This standard streamlines the integration between asset-locking and collateralizing services across various DeFi platforms. It allows NFTs representing locked assets in liquidity pools to be used as collateral, enabling liquidity providers to gain temporary liquidity without withdrawing their assets and thus maintaining pool liquidity levels.\n    [[Perpetual Contract NFTs as Collateral](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-7565.md)]\n\n*   **Automated Loan and Collateral Management:** The integration of automated features for managing the terms and conditions of collateralized NFTs helps to minimize transaction costs and complexity.\n    [[Perpetual Contract NFTs as Collateral](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-7565.md)]\n\n*   **Reduced Risk and Improved User Experience:** By keeping the NFT securely in the owner's self-custody rather than transferring it to a lending protocol's smart contract, the risk of loss or theft due to potential smart contract vulnerabilities is mitigated. This approach aims to address issues like the diminished utility and lack of composability that can arise when NFTs are transferred to an escrow.\n    [[Lockable Extension for ERC-721](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-7066.md)]",
