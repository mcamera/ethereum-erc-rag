Contracts that currently rely on the V, R, S signature validation scheme will continue to function without any issues.\n\nIn the event that both the existing V, R, S signature validation scheme and the new unstructured bytes signature validation need to be supported for backward compatibility, developers can reduce duplicates by adapting the following code block as an example:\n\n```\nfunction transferWithAuthorization(\n    address from,\n    address to,\n    uint256 value,\n    uint256 validAfter,\n    uint256 validBefore,\n    bytes32 nonce,\n    uint8 v,\n    bytes32 r,\n    bytes32 s\n) external {\n    transferWithAuthorization(owner, spender, value, deadline, abi.encodePacked(r, s, v));\n}\n```\n\n## Reference Implementation\n\n```\n/**\n  * @notice Execute a transfer with a signed authorization\n  * @dev EOA wallet signatures should be packed in the order of r, s, v.\n  * @param from          Payer's address (Authorizer)\n  * @param to            Payee's address\n  * @param value         Amount to be transferred\n  ",

This signature expresses the explicit agreement of `address to` to be publicly associated with `msg.sender` and `bytes metadata`.\n\n*   **If `address to` is a contract or `bytes signature` is empty**: An EIP-1271-compatible call to `function isValidSignatureNow(...)` must be made to `address to`.\n\nThis information is based on [ERC-4973: Account-bound Tokens](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-4973.md).",
