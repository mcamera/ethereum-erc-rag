              "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis EIP is an API for implementing voting with smart contract. This standard provides functionalities to voting as well as to view the vote result and set voting status.\n\n## Motivation\n\nVoting is one of the earliest example of EVM programming, and also a key to DAO/organizational governance process. We foresee many DAOs will ultimately need to leverage voting as one of the important part of their governance. By creating a voting standard for smart contract / token, we can have the following benefits\n\n### Benefits of having a standard\n\n1. Allow general UI and applications to be built on top of a standardized voting to allow more general user to participate, and encourage more DApp and DAO to think about their governance\n2. Allow delegate voting / smart contract voting, automatic voting\n3. Allow voting results to be recorded on-chain, in a standard way, and allow DAOs and DApps to honor the voting result programmatically.\n4. Allow the compatibility with token standard such as [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) or other new standards([ERC-777](./eip-777.md)) and item standard such as [ERC-721](./eip-721.md)\n5. Create massive potential for interoperability within Ethereum echo systems and other system.\n6. Allow setting voting deadline, allow determine on single or multiple options. Allow requiring voting orders. (trade-off is interface complexity, we might need [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) approach and later a [ERC-777](./eip-777.md) for advanced voting)\n7. Recording the voting with weights with token amount.\n8. Possibly allow trust-worthy privacy-safe voting and anonymous voting (with either voter address being un-associated with the vote they cast, given a list of randomized/obfuscated voting options).\n9. Possibly allow result in reward by voting participation or voting result.\n\n### Non-Goal / Out of Scope\n\n1. **Delegation**: We intentionally leave delegation out of scope. A separate EIP could be proposed to address this particular use case.\n2. **Eligibility or Weights**: S",

A separate EIP could be proposed to address this particular use case.\n2. **Eligibility or Weights**: Some of the implementing want to have weights or eligibility to vote to be configurable. Such as OpenZeppelin's implementation of GovernorBravo uses snapshot. Aslo weights calculation such as quadratic voting is not within the scope of this EIP. This EIP is intend to be flexible for\nany current and new voting weights calculation.\n3. **Proposal**: We intentionally leave Proposal out of scope. Proposals are going to be identified by `proposalId` but what information of the proposal includes,\nwhether they are on-chain or off-chain and whether they are exeutable, is leaved out from this proposal. A separate EIP could be proposed to address this particular use case. See one of such proposals [ERC-5247](./eip-5247.md)\n4. **Signature Aggregations / Endorsement**: When implementing contracts want to allow user to submit their vote or approval of vote offline and have some other\naccount to generate the transaction, the signature aggregations or endorsements are not in scope of this EIP.

This has the following assumptions:\n\n- It's possible to check someone's vote directly given an address. If implementor don't want to make it so easily, they can simply reject all calls to this function. We want to make sure that we support both anonymous voting an non-anonymous voting. However since all calls to a smart contract is logged in block history, there is really no secrecy unless done with cryptography tricks. I am not cryptography-savvy enough to comment on the possibility. Please see \"Second Feedback Questions 2018\" for related topic.\n\n- It's assumes for each individual address, they can only vote for one decision. They can distribute their available voting power into more granular level. If implementor wants allow this, they ask the user to create another wallet address and grant the new address certain power. For example, a token based voting where voting weight is determined by the amount of token held by a voter, a voter who wants to distribute its voting power in two different option(option set) can transfer some of the tokens to the new account and cast the votes from both accounts.\n\n### Weights\n\nWe assume there are `weight` of votes and can be checked by calling `eligibleVotingWeight(proposalId, address voter)`, and the weight distribution is either internally determined or determined by constructor.\n\n## Backwards Comp",

The `support` options are chosen to be `uint8` for the purpose to be backward compatible for GovernorBravo. It can be increased in the future\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nWe expect the voting standard to be used in connection with other contracts such as token distributions, conducting actions in consensus or on behalf of an entity, multi-signature wallets, etc.\n\nThe major security consideration is to ensure only using the standard interface for performing downstream actions or receiving upstream input (vote casting). We expect future audit tool to be based on standard interfaces.\n\nIt's also important to note as discussed in this standard that for the sake of simplicity, this EIP is kept in the very basic form. It can be extended to support many different implementation variations. Such variations might contain different assumptions of the behavior and interpretation of actions. One example would be: What does it mean if someone votes multiple times through `vote`?\n\n- Wou",

We suggest any extension or implementations of this standard be thoroughly audited before included in large scale or high asset volume applications.\n\nThe third consideration is non-triviality. Some voting applications assume **_anonymity_**, **_randomness_**, **_time-based deadline_**, **_ordering_**, etc, these requirements in Ethereum are known to be non-trivial to achieve. We suggest any applications or organizations rely on audited and time-proven shared libraries when these requirements need to be enforced in their applications.\n\nThe fourth consideration is potential abuse. When voting is standardized and put on contract, it is possible to write another contract that rewards a voter to vote in a certain way. It creates potential issues of bribery and conflict of interest abuse that is previously hard to implement.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](../LICENSE.md).",

However, the term \"Hook events\" was not explicitly found in the context of these documents, nor were specific examples of how they could be utilized for \"Automated Market Makers.\"\n\nWhile the ERC-1202 document doesn't use the term \"Hook events,\" the concept of extending a voting mechanism to allow for \"automatic voting\" or \"smart contract voting\" implies a form of programmatic interaction that could be similar to what \"Hook events\" might enable.\n\n**For DAO Voting:**\n\nERC-1202 provides a framework for DAOs to leverage voting as a core part of their governance. Although not explicitly called \"Hook events,\" the standard aims to:\n\n*   **Allow delegate voting / smart contract voting, automatic voting:** This suggests that external contracts or automated systems could interact with the voting interface to cast votes based on predefined logic or conditions. For instance, a \"hook\" could trigger a vote on behalf of a delegate or a smart contract if certain on-chain events occur or conditions are met.\n*   **Allow voting results to be recorded on-chain, in a standard way, and allow DAOs and DApps to honor the voting result programmatically:** This implies that once a vote concludes, other smart contracts or decentralized applications could \"hook into\" these results to execute actions. For example, a DAO treasury contract could automatically release funds or modify protocol parameters if a specific proposal passes with sufficient votes.\n\nIn essence, while the term \"Hook events\" is not used, the functionalities outlined in ERC-1202 enable a similar mechanism where external logic or smart contracts can react to and participate in the voting process, or react to its outcomes.\n\nRegarding \"Automated Market Makers,\" the search did not yield specific information on how \"Hook events\" could be utilized in this context within the ERC documents.\n\nIt's important to note that \"Hook events\" may refer to a more general concept or a specific implementation detail not covered within the scope of the searched ERC documents.",
