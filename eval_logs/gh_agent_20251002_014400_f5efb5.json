It also defines a new address format that encodes the extra data passed into the interface's main deposit function.\n\n## Abstract\nAn ERC-2876 compatible **deposit system** can accept ETH payments from multiple depositors without the need for managing multiple keys or requiring use of a hot wallet.\n\nAn ERC-2876 compatible **wallet application** can send ETH to ERC-2876 compatible **deposit systems** in a way that the **deposit system** can differentiate their payment using the 8 byte id specified in this standard.\n\nAdoption of ERC-2876 by all exchanges (as a deposit system and as a wallet for their withdrawal systems), merchants, and all wallet applications/libraries will likely decrease total network gas usage by these systems, since two value transactions cost 42000 gas while a simple ETH forwarding contract will cost closer to 30000 gas depending on the underlying implementation.\n\nThis also has the benefit for deposit system administrators of allowing for all deposits to be forwarded to a cold wallet directly without any manual operations to gather deposits from multiple external accounts.\n\n## Motivation\nCentralized exchanges and merchants (Below: \"apps\") require an address format for accepting deposits. Currently the address format used refers to an account (external or contract), but this creates a problem. It requires that apps create a new account for every invoice / user. If the account is external, that means the app must have the deposit addresses be hot wallets, or have increased workload for cold wallet operators (as each deposit account will create 1 value tx to sweep). If the account is contract, generating an account costs at least 60k gas for a simple proxy, which is cost-prohibitive.\n\nTherefore, merchant and centralized exchange apps are forced between taking on one of the following:\n\n- Large security risk (deposit accounts are hot wallets)\n- Large manual labor cost ",

This ERC can only handle deposits for native value (ETH) and not other protocols such as ERC-20. However, this is not considered a problem, because it is best practice to logically AND key-wise separate wallets for separate currencies in any exchange/merchant application for accounting reasons and also for security reasons. Therefore, using this method for the native value currency (ETH) and another method for ERC-20 tokens etc. is acceptable. Any attempt at doing something similar for ERC-20 would require modifying the ERC itself (by adding the id data as a new input argument to the transfer method etc.) which",

          "content": "The main motivation behind proposing a standardized deposit address format, particularly in the context of high network gas prices, is to address the inefficiencies and security risks associated with current deposit systems used by centralized exchanges and merchants.\n\nSpecifically, the ERC-2876 \"Deposit contract and address standard\" highlights the following:\n\n*   **Cost-prohibitive account generation**: Existing methods require applications to create a new account for every invoice or user. If these are contract accounts, the gas cost for deployment (at least 60k gas for a simple proxy) becomes economically unfeasible, especially when network gas prices are high.\n*   **Security risks with hot wallets**: When gas prices are high, services are often compelled to use hot wallets for deposits to minimize transaction costs, which significantly increases security risks.\n*   **Operational overhead for cold wallets**: If external accounts are used, cold wallet operators face increased manual labor to sweep deposits from numerous accounts.\n*   **Reduced gas consumption**: The standardized approach aims to lower the overall network gas usage. A direct ETH forwarding contract using this standard could cost around 30,000 gas, compared to 42,000 gas for two separate value transactions.\n*   **Simplified cold wallet management**: It allows for all deposits to be directly forwarded to a cold wallet, eliminating the need for manual operations to consolidate funds from multiple external accounts.\n\nIn essence, the standardization seeks to lower the cost of deploying and managing deposit systems, enhance security by reducing reliance on hot wallets, and improve overall gas efficiency during periods of high network congestion.\n\nReference: [ERC-2876: Deposit contract and address standard](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-2876.md)",
