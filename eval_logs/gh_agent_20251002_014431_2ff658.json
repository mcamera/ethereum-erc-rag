This standard does not set the expectation of how you might create/transfer many tokens it is only concerned with the event emitted after the creation, or transfer of ownership of these tokens. This extension assumes that token identifiers are in consecutive order.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis extension provides even more scalibility of the [ERC-721 specification](./eip-721.md). It is possible to create, transfer, and burn 2^256 non-fungible tokens in one transaction. However, it is not possible to emit that many `Transfer` events in one transaction. The `Transfer` event is part of the original specification which states:\n\n> This emits when ownership of any NFT changes by any mechanism.\n> This event emits when NFTs are created (`from` == 0) and destroyed\n> (`to` == 0). Exception: during contract creation, any number of NFTs\n> may be created and assigned without emitting Transfer. At the time of\n> any transfer, the approved address for that NFT (if any) is reset to none.\n\nThis allows for the original `Transfer` event to be emitted for one token at a time, which in turn gives us O(n) time complexity.

By specifying a range of consecutive token identifiers we can easily cover the transfer, or creation of 2^(256) tokens and decentralized platforms can react accordingly.\n\nTake this example. I sell magical fruit and have a farm with 10,000 magical fruit trees each with different fruit and 1,000 new trees every few years. I want to turn each tree into a non-fungible token that people can own. Each person that owns one of my non-fungible tree tokens will receive a quarterly percentage of each harvest from that tree. The problem is that I would need to create and transfer each of these tokens individually - which will cost me a lot of time and money and frankly would keep me from doing this.\n\nWith this extension I would be able to mint my initial 10,000  tree tokens in one transaction. I would be able to quickly and cheaply mint my additional 1,000  tree tokens when a new batch is planted. I would then be able to transfer all of the 10,000+ tree tokens to a special smart contract that keeps track of the selling and distribution of funds in one transaction all while adhering to a specified standard.\n\n**Rationale to have a single event that covers minting, burning, and transferring**\n\nThe `ConsecutiveTransfer` event can be used to cover minting, burning, and transferring events.

Therefore, their behavior would depend on how they are defined within that specific context.\n\nIn general, for smart contract functions:\n\n*   **`revert` calls**: When a function call results in a `revert`, all state changes made during that transaction are undone, and any gas not consumed is refunded. The transaction fails, and no events are emitted.\n*   **Consecutive function calls with identical parameters**: The behavior would depend on the function's implementation.\n    *   **Pure/View functions**: If the functions are `pure` or `view` (i.e., they don't modify the blockchain state), consecutive calls with the same parameters should return the same result.\n    *   **State-modifying functions**: If the functions modify the state, consecutive calls with identical parameters might lead to different outcomes depending on the state changes from the first call. For example, if a function `mintToken(address to)` is called twice with the same `to` address, the second call might fail if the contract only allows one token per address, or it might mint another token if that's the intended behavior.\n\nTo understand the exact behavior of `hasAttribute` and `getAttributeValue`, you would need to consult the specific ERC or contract where these functions are defined.",
