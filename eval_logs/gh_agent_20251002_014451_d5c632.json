              "content": "## Simple Summary\nTo simply and cheaply clone contract functionality in an immutable way, this standard specifies a minimal bytecode implementation that delegates all calls to a known, fixed address.  \n## Abstract\nBy standardizing on a known minimal bytecode redirect implementation, this standard allows users and third party tools (e.g. Etherscan) to (a) simply discover that a contract will always redirect in a known manner and (b) depend on the behavior of the code at the destination contract as the behavior of the redirecting contract.  Specifically, tooling can interrogate the bytecode at a redirecting address to determine the location of the code that will run - and can depend on representations about that code (verified source, third-party audits, etc).  This implementation forwards all calls and 100% of the gas to the implementation contract and then relays the return value back to the caller.  In the case where the implementation reverts, the revert is passed back along with the payload data (for revert with message).\n\n## Motivation\nThis standard supports use-cases wherein it is desirable to clone exact contract functionality with a minimum of side effects (e.g. memory slot stomping) and with low gas cost deployment of duplicate proxies.\n\n## Specification\nThe exact bytecode of the standard clone contract is this: `363d3d373d3d3d363d73bebebebebebebebebebebebebebebebebebebebe5af43d82803e903d91602b57fd5bf3` wherein the bytes at indices 10 - 29 (inclusive) are replaced with the 20 byte address of the master functionality contract.  \n\nA reference implementation of this can be found at the [optionality/clone-factory](https://github.com/optionality/clone-factory) github repo. \n\n## Rationale\nThe goals of this effort have been the following:\n- inexpensive deployment (low gas to deploy clones)\n- support clone initialization in creation transaction (through factory contract model)\n- simple clone bytecode to encourage directly bytecode interrogation (see CloneProbe.sol i",

By generating a master contract vanity address that includes Z leading 0 bytes in its address, you can shorten the proxy bytecode by replacing the `push20` opcode with `pushN` (where N is 20 - Z) followed by the N non-zero address bytes.  The revert jump address is decremented by Z in this case.
