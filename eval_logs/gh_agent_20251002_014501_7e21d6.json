This `tokenId` is essential for verification during the unwrap process. It also serves as the exclusive credential for the token. This mechanism ensures the security of assets in contracts. \n\n### Wrap and Mint\n\nThe `strategy` is set while implementing the Agency interface, and it should be ensured not upgradable once deployed.\n\nWhen executing the `wrap` function, the predetermined strategy parameters are passed into the `getWrapOracle` function to fetch the current premium and fee. The respective premium is then transferred to the Agency instance; the fee, according to `mintFeePercent` is transferred to `feeRecipient`. Subsequently, the App mints the NFT to the user's address.\n\nPremium(tokens) transferred into the Agency cannot be moved, except through the unwrap process. The act of executing wrap is the sole trigger for the mint process. \n\n### Unwrap and Burn\n\nWhen e",

To ensure the backward compatibility, considering some contracts which do not implement `ERC721TokenReceiver`, `IERC7527App` employ `mint` function instead of `safeMint`. To ensure the safety and the uniqueness of mutual bound, the `_from` parameter of the `burn` function in `IERC5679Ext721` must be the contract address of the bounded agency. Thus, `burn` function in `IERC7527App` does not contain the `_from` parameter. \n\n### Mutual Bound\n\nImplement contracts for `IERC7527App` and `IERC7527Agency` so that they are each other's only owner. The wrap process is to check the premium amount of the fungible token received and then mint non-fungible token in the App. Only the owner or an approver of the non-fungible token can unwrap it.\n\n### Implementation Diversity \n\nUsers can customize function and fee percentage when implement the Agency and the App interfaces.\n\nDifferent Agency implementations have distinct wrap, unwrap function logic, and different oracleFunction. Users can customize the currency, initial price, fee receiving address, fee rate, etc., to initialize the Agency contract. \n\nDifferent App implementations cater to various use cases. Users can initialize the App contract.\n\nFactory is not required. Factory implementation is need-based.

These LPs deposit tokens into liquidity pools, facilitating exchanges by providing the liquidity. The removal or withdrawal of these LPs can introduce significant volatility, as it directly impacts the available liquidity in the market. \n\nIn a FOAMM system, the liquidity is added or removed internally through `wrap` or `unwrap`.

Users can initialize the App contract according to their specific needs.\n\nThis customization allows for diverse product creations by combining different Agency and App implementations.\n\nReference: [ERC-7527: Token Bound Function Oracle AMM](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-7527.md)",
